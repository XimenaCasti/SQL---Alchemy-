This project focuses on performing climate analysis and data exploration of a climate database using Python, SQLAlchemy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. The analyses a climate database and visualizing the data. Additionally, a Flask API is created to display the results of the queries.

PART 1: The analysis perfomrs the following 

a. Find Most Recent Date in Dataset:
b. Retrieve 12 Months of Precipitation Data:
c. Select Date and Precipitation Values:
d. Load Results into a Pandas DataFrame:
e. Sort DataFrame by Date:
f. Plotting Precipitation Data:
g. Query Total Number of Stations:
h. Find the Most Active Stations:
i. Query Temperature Data for Most Active Station:
j. Retrieve TOBS Data for Most Active Station:

2. PART 2: Design Your Climate App

DevelopED a Flask API based on the above queries in the following routes:

a. Homepage (/): Available routes
b. /api/v1.0/precipitation: Retrieves only the last 12 months of data
c. /api/v1.0/stations: list of stations from the dataset
d. /api/v1.0/tobs: emperature observations of the most-active station for the previous year of data
e. /api/v1.0/<start> and /api/v1.0/<start>/<end> : Minimum temperature, the average temperature, and the maximum temperature for a specified start or start-end range.
